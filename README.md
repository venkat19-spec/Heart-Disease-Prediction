# Heart-Disease-Prediction

## Predict which patients are more likely to suffer heart disease in the near future.
◦ Created **modified version of data** by transforming ordinal features to categorical names and conversion
of data types for better interpretation. 
◦ Performed **EDA** to gain insights in distributions in subcategories of each variable, hist plots to check
skewness, boxplots for outlier analysis, scatter plots & correlation matrix to analyze correlation
between variables. \
◦ Performed **data preprocessing** with techniques such as label encoding, one hot encoding and data
scaling. \
◦ Performed **hypothesis testing** to check significance of features using tests such as Chi-Square,
T-Test, Z-test. \
◦ Implemented and tested **classfication models** such as KNN, Logistic Regression, Ensemble
Methods(Bagging & Boosting). **Achieved accuracy of 98.5% with Bagging.**
